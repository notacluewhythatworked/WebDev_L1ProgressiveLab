            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>I'm Wesley Thacker, a 19-year-old with several ambitions but not really making any of them a reality :). In addition to being a student at Neumont, I also work a full-time job as a <em>security officer</em>. I happened to graduate in <strong>2019</strong>, but delayed my entry to Neumont because of my want to serve a mission for my church. But alas, COVID-19 messed stuff up for us all so here I am!<br></p>
            <h2>A bit more detailed</h2>
            <p>I've always lived in Utah, and that fact usually surprises people, especially when I tell them about the tiny town I grew up in. I grew up in a very tiny town called Altamont, Utah. Not a lot of people have heard about it, or even the towns surrounding it. The closest town you <em>may </em>have heard of is called Vernal, but even then it's a stretch. I grew up around lots of wildlife and livestock so it's fun to see other people get queezy about it.<br>
            I moved to Salt Lake for college, and I've liked it so far. My favorite part would definitely be my job. Call me crazy, but I love my job and my parents call me an "adrenaline junky" because of it. Perhaps I'll follow the path of security through computer science. Who knows? But that's a plan for later :).</p>
